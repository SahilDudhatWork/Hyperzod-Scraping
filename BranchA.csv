This wooden shed comes with an improved design, featuring fully modular panels. This means it’s delivered in smaller sections but you get more wood, making for an easier assembly, more versatile configuration and a much stronger shed. All in all, the Forest 4Life range of sheds are the best overlap sheds we've ever made.

Supported by 30%-thicker framing than found on most wooden sheds, this 8x6 shed with lean too is constructed using straight-cut 7mm boards that overlap to give flexibility, allowing natural movement of the timber during the changing seasons and aiding rain water run-off. The pressure treatment that has been applied gives this shed a 25-year anti-rot guarantee, giving you maintenance freedom, preservative treatment is NEVER needed!  You'll only ever need one shed with a 4Life Shed!

Rather than the more common OSB (oriented strand board), this garden shed features solid timber floor, allowing for the storage of heavier items. The roof of this apex shed is made from hardwearing 8mm solid sheet, finished with a green mineral felt cover for complete weatherproof protection. 

This 8x6 shed’s door features a double-Z frame, for increased strength and to prevent the door from dropping MOVEMENT Security is enhanced with hidden hinges and a padlock-ready simple and secure hasp and staple latch to keep valuable items safe (padlock not included).

With its traditional apex roof, smooth-planed barge boards and diamond-shaped finial, this wooden shed with lean to will look good in any garden. Handcrafted in the UK using FSC® certified timber, this garden shed with lean to comes with a full set of fixings and clear instructions to help you achieve a straightforward assembly. The Lean To should be built at the same time as the shed.

This shed is delivered free to most UK addresses, using Forest Garden's White Glove Delivery Service, so will be dropped off wherever you want it in your garden, with all packaging removed.","166589","1,0",0.00,"INACTIVE",0,"Gardens & Landscaping",0
