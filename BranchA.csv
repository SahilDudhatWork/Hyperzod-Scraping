Featuring a patented PSD® drive system to enable smooth, stable driving and Stick-Fit® one-handed installation, this trade pack includes 1,000 screws in five sizes from 25-70mm.
A thick core diameter ensures superior strength throughout the body of the screw, and also under the head area. With a sharp point and prominent thread at the tip, you’ll get a rapid start and immediate thread engagement – this saves time and effort, helping you drive more screws per charge if using a cordless tool.
A slotted shank reduces wood splitting, and a countersunk head complete with ribs ensures a flush finish. Screws 40mm and shorter don’t have the ribs, to make them hinge-compatible. As well as five popular sizes, the pack also includes five Stick-Fit® driver bits. A high-quality Stick-Fit driver bit is included in every single box of Ulti-Mate Wood Screws.

Connect it directly to your power tools or sweep up and enjoy a dust-free environment. The V-TÜF®M CLASS MINI is M-Class Rated, the ‘Minimum Requirement’ for construction sites. Unrated vacuum cleaners are extremely dangerous as respirable dust can pass through the motor and be pumped back into the air. This dust then remains airborne for up to 8 hours, where it can be inhaled directly into your lung chamber, where it will remain forever. Approximately 700 people in the UK die every year due to illness relating to the inhalation of respirable dust. Needless to say, this dust also damages your vacuum motor. The V-TÜF®M CLASS MINI offers you affordable compliance and protection from common dust-related health issues! The new M CLASS MINI is a keystone that helps V-TUF achieve its mission: To save and improve the lives of those in their line of duty. Ideal for: Construction & woodworking Industries.
