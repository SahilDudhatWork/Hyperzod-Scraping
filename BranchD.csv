The pent roof style is perfect for situating against a back wall or fence. 
This wooden shed comes with an improved design, featuring fully modular panels. This means it’s delivered in smaller sections but you get more wood, making for an easier assembly, more versatile configuration and a much stronger shed. All in all, the Forest 4Life range of sheds are the best overlap sheds we've ever made.

Supported by 30%-thicker framing than found on most wooden sheds, this 8x6 shed is constructed using straight-cut 7mm boards that overlap to give flexibility, allowing natural movement of the timber during the changing seasons and aiding rain water run-off. The pressure treatment that has been applied gives this shed a 25-year anti-rot guarantee, giving you maintenance freedom, preservative treatment is NEVER needed!  You'll only ever need one shed with a 4Life Shed!

Rather than the more common OSB (oriented strand board), this garden shed features solid timber floor, allowing for the storage of heavier items. The roof of this pent shed is made from hardwearing 8mm solid sheet, finished with a green mineral felt cover for complete weatherproof protection. 

This 8x6 shed’s door features a double-Z frame, for increased strength and to prevent door movement Security is enhanced with hidden hinges and a padlock-ready simple and secure hasp and staple latch to keep valuable items safe (padlock not included). What’s more, the door can be fitted with a left or right-hand opening – the choice is yours.

"","Velux Standard Slate Flashing Including Bdx Insulation Collar to Suit MK08 Roof Window 780 x 1398mm","https://dam-assets.apps.travisperkins.group/4b2Rk/GPID_1000785762_IMG_00.jpg","The VELUX Pro+ flashing set is designed to ensure a perfect installation with extra insulation. 

The VELUX Pro+ flashing set comes with an easy-to-fit underfelt collar that includes an integrated drainage gutter. The underfelt collar creates a tight seal between the roof window, battens and the roofing underfelt. The drainage gutter gives you extra security by draining away any water that gets through to the roofing underfelt safely and effectively from the top of the roof window. 

The VELUX Pro+ flashing set also includes an insulation frame that insulates the gap between the roof window and the roof construction. This reduces heat loss and eliminates cold bridges.

Whatever your VELUX window size or type, the flashing set fits perfectly and provides a durable and weathertight seal that can stand the test of time.","567538","1,0",140.32,"INACTIVE",0,"Roof Windows",122.02

With Vista you get strong, light and super slim aluminium roof profiles with exceptional thermal performance as well as stunning looks. The thermally broken aluminium rafters not only make this one of the most thermally efficient lanterns on the market it also reduces the visible width by up to 30% and the main feature ridge by up to 70% compared to competitors. These extra strong rafters mean the tie bars can be set higher, guaranteeing excellent headroom and no intrusion into the living area. Even in large buildings the roof structure remains remarkably minimal, creating a sense of clear, free space under the eaves.

Vista roof lights can be made to order in any size and any RAL colour and all aluminium exterior coloured profiles are quality finished with powder coat paint, which is guaranteed to last. A U-Value (W/m2K) is simply a measure of heat loss from a building structure â€“ for instance a roof, or a window and frame. A high U-Value means thermal insulation is poor whilst a low U-Value indicates a good thermal insulation. As a glazed roof is made up of both glass and rafters, you want low U-Values from both. High performance glass is usually rated at 1.1 or 1.2 U-Value, but the value of roof rafters vary considerably. The Vista rafter has a U-value of 1.5 W/m2k which is twice as thermally efficient as its nearest competitor (which are over 3). When using double glazed Low e glass (U-value 1.1W/m2k) the overall Vista roof has a U-value of as low as 1.2 W/m2k. The profiles in this range have been designed solely for roof glazing. This system can cope with varying degrees of roof pitch, from 3 to 45, and provides a complete thermally broken structure when complete. All Vista Glaze Roof lanterns come with a 10 year guarantee but The British Board of Agreement tested the roof system and have indicated that the roof will have a life expectancy of at least 25 years.

It is suitable for bonding ceramic tiles, quarry tiles, porcelain, vitrified tiles, natural stone and mosaics to wall and floors.

This white, rapid-setting wall and floor tile adhesive is formulated for fast track installation and enables tiles to be grouted in approximately 2 to 3 hours after fixing, depending on conditions. It provides excellent grip and adhesion.

Bostik Vitri-Flex tile adhesive is suitable for most interior and exterior installations including more demanding installations, such as use with underfloor heating and areas subject to limited vibration.
