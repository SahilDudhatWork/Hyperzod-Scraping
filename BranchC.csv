Ideal product to replace most existing front door locks and is ideally suited for panelled doors. Particularly suitable for glass panelled doors, as the ergonomic internal locking handle, which can be deadlocked by an anti-clockwise turn of the key from the inside, offers additional security against forced entry. The main bolt is ""automatically"" deadlocked into the striker, when the door is closed, preventing it from being retracted by a credit card. Designed with a 20mm bolt throw for even greater security and strength. A simple snib button enables the latch to be held in the withdrawn position (only), allowing the door to be accessible without operating the handle. The British Standard Nightlatch is a face fitted, non handed design enabling both left and right handed operation; and the striker is designed with a 3 hole fixing for additional strength and security. The lock conforms to British Standard 3621:2007 (BS EN 12209) and meets the tough criteria/requirements laid down by insurance companies and the police. Suitable for inward opening interior and exterior timber doors only. The external cylinder features a high security integral cylinder pull, which protects the cylinder from being drilled. The cylinder has over 30.000 cut key variations and is supplied with 3 cut keys. All finishes meet the requirements of BS EN 1670:2007 Grade 3 (96 hours) for Corrosion Resistance to provide the most robust finish for your hardware.","9038385557","1,1",72.43,"ACTIVE",1,"Doors, Windows & Joinery",62.98

Featuring a patented PSD® drive system to enable smooth, stable driving and Stick-Fit® one-handed installation, this trade pack includes 1,000 screws in five sizes from 25-70mm.
A thick core diameter ensures superior strength throughout the body of the screw, and also under the head area. With a sharp point and prominent thread at the tip, you’ll get a rapid start and immediate thread engagement – this saves time and effort, helping you drive more screws per charge if using a cordless tool.
A slotted shank reduces wood splitting, and a countersunk head complete with ribs ensures a flush finish. Screws 40mm and shorter don’t have the ribs, to make them hinge-compatible. As well as five popular sizes, the pack also includes five Stick-Fit® driver bits. A high-quality Stick-Fit driver bit is included in every single box of Ulti-Mate Wood Screws. The screws also feature a type-17 point to drive through the hardest timber, a double-angle countersunk head for a neat finish and a wide, deep single thread for rapid insertion and strong holding power.","4599675815","1,4",27.72,"ACTIVE",4,"Fixings & Adhesives",24.1

With its timeless, sleek design, the Rebris S 110 CoolStart basin tap with pop-up waste will visibly enhance your bathroom. The sleek, rounded shapes and precision surfaces create an atmosphere of well-being. Rebris S includes modern designer taps at a fair price. Make your own dream bathroom a reality.
The renowned hansgrohe quality brings the promises of a winning design to life: A high-quality ceramic mixer system controls the water volume and temperature. This keeps working smoothly and reliably even after frequent use. Want to save water and energy? Yes, totally automatically: when the handle is in the centre position, only cold water flows. Hot water will only run if it is turned to the left (CoolStart). The flow rate is limited to max. 5 l/min even at high water pressure (EcoSmart). For a full water jet, the single lever tap enriches the water with air (AirPower). This creates a soft jet that sprays less â€“ meet the beauty of water.
Practical functions for greater convenience
A pop-up waste set is included. It allows the waste plug to be easily controlled using one hand. The tap is even suitable for hard water. The aerator can be removed for cleaning and descaled using a coin. No tools needed. This keeps the tap looking like new.


Temperature limitation can be set during installation to protect against water that is too hot
Easy installation: Flexible connection hoses make installation easier (size: DN15)
Suitable for continuous flow water heaters and therefore versatile use
Guaranteed availability: Spare parts are available for up to 15 years after the range has been discontinued","2405207656","1,3",150.65,"ACTIVE",3,"Bathrooms",131

Replacing worn blades is safe and easy with a blade release button that removes used blades before loading a new one by simply pulling the actuator back and flicking it forward again. With a simple press of the magazine release, a positive, spring-loaded magazine ejector drops the magazine away from the tool or into an open hand. A new magazine can then be loaded inside, making it easy to switch from one type of blade to another in a flash. All Toughbuilt mags have an indicator switch. Positions 1, 2 or 3 remind the Pro what type of blade is loaded in a magazine without having to remove the magazine from a pouch or pocket. The Reload Knife is quality constructed from smooth aluminum alloy and zinc alloy for corrosion resistance. It is wrapped in a rugged, grippy, non-slip soft-touch rubber housing to protect the tool from shocks and drops while creating a more dexterous hand purchase on the instrument. The finger guard helps keep pros safe while cutting tough materials. It includes a five-pack of ToughBuilt universal straight-edge blades and a five-pack of ToughBuilt specialized hook blades that use a smart, precision-milled, proprietary edge design. The straight edge blades work interchangeably with the Reload Knife and the ToughBuilt Scraper Utility Knife or any standard utility knife.","6087539542","1,5",22.98,"ACTIVE",5,"Tools & Workwear",19.98

Unlike most other types of carpet protector, our special water-based adhesive allows it to be used on all types of carpet, including those made from natural fibers like wool.

No special applicator is required. Instead, rolls are reverse wound which means they can be simply dropped in place and quickly kicked out to unroll.

Hippo High-Performance Carpet Protector is certified fire retardant and meets UK fire regulations. This means that it can be left down in commercial buildings for up to 30 days.","9244952257","1,25",46.00,"ACTIVE",25,"Decorating & Interiors",40
