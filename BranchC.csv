The British Standard Nightlatch is a face fitted, non handed design enabling both left and right handed operation; and the striker is designed with a 3 hole fixing for additional strength and security. The lock conforms to British Standard 3621:2007 (BS EN 12209) and meets the tough criteria/requirements laid down by insurance companies and the police. Suitable for inward opening interior and exterior timber doors only. The external cylinder features a high security integral cylinder pull, which protects the cylinder from being drilled.

Featuring a patented PSD® drive system to enable smooth, stable driving and Stick-Fit® one-handed installation, this trade pack includes 1,000 screws in five sizes from 25-70mm.
A thick core diameter ensures superior strength throughout the body of the screw, and also under the head area. With a sharp point and prominent thread at the tip, you’ll get a rapid start and immediate thread engagement – this saves time and effort, helping you drive more screws per charge if using a cordless tool.
A slotted shank reduces wood splitting, and a countersunk head complete with ribs ensures a flush finish. Screws 40mm and shorter don’t have the ribs, to make them hinge-compatible. As well as five popular sizes, the pack also includes five Stick-Fit® driver bits. A high-quality Stick-Fit driver bit is included in every single box of Ulti-Mate Wood Screws. The screws also feature a type-17 point to drive through the hardest timber, a double-angle countersunk head for a neat finish and a wide, deep single thread for rapid insertion and strong holding power.","3885059893","1,4",27.72,"ACTIVE",4,"Fixings & Adhesives",24.1

With its timeless, sleek design, the Rebris S 110 CoolStart basin tap with pop-up waste will visibly enhance your bathroom. The sleek, rounded shapes and precision surfaces create an atmosphere of well-being. Rebris S includes modern designer taps at a fair price. Make your own dream bathroom a reality.
The renowned hansgrohe quality brings the promises of a winning design to life: A high-quality ceramic mixer system controls the water volume and temperature. This keeps working smoothly and reliably even after frequent use. Want to save water and energy? Yes, totally automatically: when the handle is in the centre position, only cold water flows. Hot water will only run if it is turned to the left (CoolStart). The flow rate is limited to max. 5 l/min even at high water pressure (EcoSmart). For a full water jet, the single lever tap enriches the water with air (AirPower). This creates a soft jet that sprays less â€“ meet the beauty of water.
Practical functions for greater convenience
A pop-up waste set is included. It allows the waste plug to be easily controlled using one hand. The tap is even suitable for hard water. The aerator can be removed for cleaning and descaled using a coin. No tools needed. This keeps the tap looking like new.


Temperature limitation can be set during installation to protect against water that is too hot
Easy installation: Flexible connection hoses make installation easier (size: DN15)
Suitable for continuous flow water heaters and therefore versatile use
Guaranteed availability: Spare parts are available for up to 15 years after the range has been discontinued","6409876989","1,3",150.65,"ACTIVE",3,"Bathrooms",131
