Featuring a patented PSD® drive system to enable smooth, stable driving and Stick-Fit® one-handed installation, this trade pack includes 1,000 screws in five sizes from 25-70mm.
A thick core diameter ensures superior strength throughout the body of the screw, and also under the head area. With a sharp point and prominent thread at the tip, you’ll get a rapid start and immediate thread engagement – this saves time and effort, helping you drive more screws per charge if using a cordless tool.
A slotted shank reduces wood splitting, and a countersunk head complete with ribs ensures a flush finish. Screws 40mm and shorter don’t have the ribs, to make them hinge-compatible. As well as five popular sizes, the pack also includes five Stick-Fit® driver bits. A high-quality Stick-Fit driver bit is included in every single box of Ulti-Mate Wood Screws. The screws also feature a type-17 point to drive through the hardest timber, a double-angle countersunk head for a neat finish and a wide, deep single thread for rapid insertion and strong holding power.","4825641208","1,3",23.09,"ACTIVE",3,"Fixings & Adhesives",20.08,"",20
