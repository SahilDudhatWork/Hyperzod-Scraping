Using patented technology it revolutionizes the handling of various materials such as tiles, stone, concrete, drywall, plywood, windows, and furniture. The Grabo is versatile, allowing for material handling of glass, sheet metal, windows, doors, hardwood products, timber, beams, plastic sheets, tiles, rough concrete, plasterboard, and even household appliances and furniture.

The Grabo Plus offers immense benefits to individuals involved in lifting and moving heavy objects. Whether it's pavers working with heavy stones, tilers seeking precision placement, or removal companies dealing with awkward furniture, the Grabo allows you to put a handle on almost anything! The original Grabo Plus offers manual controls but matches the 170kg lifting capacity of the Grabo Pro.

The Grabo Plus reduces the risk of strain and injury associated with manual lifting of heavy objects. It allows for a more controlled and ergonomic handling of materials, minimizing the potential for accidents or musculoskeletal issues. By reducing the physical strain on workers and providing a secure grip on materials, the Grabo Plus Tool promotes a safer working environment.","5150135956","1,3",287.50,"ACTIVE",3,"Bathrooms",250,"",20

Connect it directly to your power tools or sweep up and enjoy a dust-free environment. The V-TÜF®M CLASS MINI is M-Class Rated, the ‘Minimum Requirement’ for construction sites. Unrated vacuum cleaners are extremely dangerous as respirable dust can pass through the motor and be pumped back into the air. This dust then remains airborne for up to 8 hours, where it can be inhaled directly into your lung chamber, where it will remain forever. Approximately 700 people in the UK die every year due to illness relating to the inhalation of respirable dust. Needless to say, this dust also damages your vacuum motor. The V-TÜF®M CLASS MINI offers you affordable compliance and protection from common dust-related health issues! The new M CLASS MINI is a keystone that helps V-TUF achieve its mission: To save and improve the lives of those in their line of duty. Ideal for: Construction & woodworking Industries. No reason to not embrace the M Class protection.","2836721560","1,2",172.22,"ACTIVE",2,"Tools & Workwear",149.76,"",20

Unlike most other types of carpet protector, our special water-based adhesive allows it to be used on all types of carpet, including those made from natural fibers like wool.

No special applicator is required. Instead, rolls are reverse wound which means they can be simply dropped in place and quickly kicked out to unroll.

Hippo High-Performance Carpet Protector is certified fire retardant and meets UK fire regulations. This means that it can be left down in commercial buildings for up to 30 days.","9231204982","1,183",38.33,"ACTIVE",183,"Decorating & Interiors",33.33,"",20

Installation can be reduced by around 40% against traditional fixing methods Note: With all plastic pipes the relevant manufacturer’s pipe insert is required.","6773445907","1,8",10.17,"ACTIVE",8,"Plumbing",8.84,"",20
