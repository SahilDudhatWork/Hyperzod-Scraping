Positions 1, 2 or 3 remind the Pro what type of blade is loaded in a magazine without having to remove the magazine from a pouch or pocket. The Reload Knife is quality constructed from smooth aluminum alloy and zinc alloy for corrosion resistance. It is wrapped in a rugged, grippy, non-slip soft-touch rubber housing to protect the tool from shocks and drops while creating a more dexterous hand purchase on the instrument. The finger guard helps keep pros safe while cutting tough materials.
