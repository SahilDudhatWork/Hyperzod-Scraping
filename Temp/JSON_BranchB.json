This dust then remains airborne for up to 8 hours, where it can be inhaled directly into your lung chamber, where it will remain forever. Approximately 700 people in the UK die every year due to illness relating to the inhalation of respirable dust. Needless to say, this dust also damages your vacuum motor. The V-TÜF®M CLASS MINI offers you affordable compliance and protection from common dust-related health issues! The new M CLASS MINI is a keystone that helps V-TUF achieve its mission: To save and improve the lives of those in their line of duty. Ideal for: Construction & woodworking Industries.

    "description": "The ToughBuilt® Reload Utility Knife is an innovative quick-change tool expertly crafted from professional-grade materials with a groundbreaking, patented mechanism that accepts spring-loaded blade magazines and autoloads a fresh blade with the flick of a switch. Replacing worn blades is safe and easy with a blade release button that removes used blades before loading a new one by simply pulling the actuator back and flicking it forward again. With a simple press of the magazine release, a positive, spring-loaded magazine ejector drops the magazine away from the tool or into an open hand. A new magazine can then be loaded inside, making it easy to switch from one type of blade to another in a flash. All Toughbuilt mags have an indicator switch. Positions 1, 2 or 3 remind the Pro what type of blade is loaded in a magazine without having to remove the magazine from a pouch or pocket. The Reload Knife is quality constructed from smooth aluminum alloy and zinc alloy for corrosion resistance. It is wrapped in a rugged, grippy, non-slip soft-touch rubber housing to protect the tool from shocks and drops while creating a more dexterous hand purchase on the instrument. The finger guard helps keep pros safe while cutting tough materials. It includes a five-pack of ToughBuilt universal straight-edge blades and a five-pack of ToughBuilt specialized hook blades that use a smart, precision-milled, proprietary edge design. The straight edge blades work interchangeably with the Reload Knife and the ToughBuilt Scraper Utility Knife or any standard utility knife.",
