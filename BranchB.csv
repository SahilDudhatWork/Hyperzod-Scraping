The strength-to-weight ratio of Vista aluminium profile offers spectacular roof spans without the need for tie bars. No clunky bars or supports cluttering the ridge and no thick, chunky profiles dominating the glazing. With Vista you get strong, light and super slim aluminium roof profiles with exceptional thermal performance as well as stunning looks. The thermally broken aluminium rafters not only make this one of the most thermally efficient lanterns on the market it also reduces the visible width by up to 30% and the main feature ridge by up to 70% compared to competitors. These extra strong rafters mean the tie bars can be set higher, guaranteeing excellent headroom and no intrusion into the living area. Even in large buildings the roof structure remains remarkably minimal, creating a sense of clear, free space under the eaves.

Vista roof lights can be made to order in any size and any RAL colour and all aluminium exterior coloured profiles are quality finished with powder coat paint, which is guaranteed to last. A U-Value (W/m2K) is simply a measure of heat loss from a building structure â€“ for instance a roof, or a window and frame. A high U-Value means thermal insulation is poor whilst a low U-Value indicates a good thermal insulation. As a glazed roof is made up of both glass and rafters, you want low U-Values from both. High performance glass is usually rated at 1.1 or 1.2 U-Value, but the value of roof rafters vary considerably. The Vista rafter has a U-value of 1.5 W/m2k which is twice as thermally efficient as its nearest competitor (which are over 3). When using double glazed Low e glass (U-value 1.1W/m2k) the overall Vista roof has a U-value of as low as 1.2 W/m2k. The profiles in this range have been designed solely for roof glazing. This system can cope with varying degrees of roof pitch, from 3 to 45, and provides a complete thermally broken structure when complete. All Vista Glaze Roof lanterns come with a 10 year guarantee but The British Board of Agreement tested the roof system and have indicated that the roof will have a life expectancy of at least 25 years. 
Contemporary schemes often dictate minimal intrusion â€“ for instance to maximise open-plan layouts and create high roof spaces. Large spans with Atlas can be achieved easily without the need for unsightly bolster bars.","993430","1,0",1911.09,"INACTIVE",0,"Roof Windows",1661.82

The VELUX Pro+ flashing set comes with an easy-to-fit underfelt collar that includes an integrated drainage gutter. The underfelt collar creates a tight seal between the roof window, battens and the roofing underfelt. The drainage gutter gives you extra security by draining away any water that gets through to the roofing underfelt safely and effectively from the top of the roof window. 

The VELUX Pro+ flashing set also includes an insulation frame that insulates the gap between the roof window and the roof construction. This reduces heat loss and eliminates cold bridges.

Whatever your VELUX window size or type, the flashing set fits perfectly and provides a durable and weathertight seal that can stand the test of time.","750972","1,0",152.77,"INACTIVE",0,"Roof Windows",132.84
